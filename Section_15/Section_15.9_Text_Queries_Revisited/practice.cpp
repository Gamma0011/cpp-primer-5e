/*
    We will now expand the original query.h from Chapter 12 to support additional functionality. This includes:

        - Finaling all lines that match a given string
        - ~ operator to print lines not matching string
        - | operator returning lines of either two queries
        - & operator, returning lines for both

        _ Additionally, we should be able to combine these: fiery & bird | wind

    We'll use normally C++ precedence rules, meaning we'll match whatever comes first, either fiery & bird or wind

    Our output will print the query, using parentheses to indicate the way in which the query was interpreted.

    || AN OBJECT-ORIENTED APPROACH ||
