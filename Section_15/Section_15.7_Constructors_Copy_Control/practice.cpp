/*
    Like any other class, a class in an inheritance heirarchy controls what happens when objects of its type are created, copied, moved, assigned and destroyed.
     If a class (base or derived) does not define one of the copy-control operations, the compiler will synthesize that operator. Also, as usual,
     the synthesized version of any of these members might be a deleted function.
