/*
    | VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS |
        Dynamic binding happens when a virtual member function is called through & or * to base-class type.
         Because we don't know the version of a function at compile, virtual functions must ALWAYS be defined.
         We MUST DECLARED every virtual fuction, regardless of whether it is used, because the compiler will have
         no way of determining whether a virtual function is used.
