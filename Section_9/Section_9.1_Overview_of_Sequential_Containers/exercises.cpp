/*
    e91 - which is the most appropriate - a vector, a deque, or a list - for the following program tasks?

    a) read a fixed number of words, inserting them into the container alphabetically as they are entered.
        list - potential need for fast access to elements at random locations within the container.
    b) read an unknown number of words, always insert new words at the back, remove the next value from the front
        deque - only accessing the front and back of container to perform operations
    c) read an unknown number of ints from a file. sort the numbers and then print them in the std::cout;
        vector - ability to interate through container will make it easier to sort the numbers then print output
