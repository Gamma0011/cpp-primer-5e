/*
    || USING AN UNORDERED CONTAINER ||
        Rather than using a comparison function to organize unordered container elements, these containers
         use a hash function and the key type's == operator. An unordered container is most useful when we have a key type
         for which there is no obvious ordering relationship among the elements. These containers are also useful
         for applications in which the cost of maintaining elements in order is prohibitive.

        Although hashing can gibe better average cast performance, it require a lot of work and tweaking. In most cases,
         it is easier and often yields better performance to use an ordered container.
